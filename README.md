# Serendipity-Donation-App
Serendipity is an online donation portal. 
It first allows users to choose a country from India, the UAE, or the USA. 
It then offers people the choice of donating food, clothing, toys, books, or money 
(for causes like Cancer, Children, Covid-19, People of Determination, Underprivileged and Women). 
They are redirected to the organization's website after clicking on any of the organizations.
